Original website from a course tutorial from Brad Traversy @ Traversy Media. Website was made from scratch with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js, using the TMDB API.

I added an Upcoming section to the header and the ability to search up actors from the API. There is also a page that displays current popular actors. Each actor has their own page with some simple information.

I also changed up some of the styling and added some more responsiveness.
