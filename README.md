Original website from a course tutorial from Brad Traversy @ Traversy Media. Website was made from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I added an Upcoming section to the header and the ability to search up actors from the API. There is also a page that displays current popular actors. Each actor has their own page with some simple information.

I also changed up some of the styling and added some more responsiveness.

Netlify does not allow server-side hosting so I do have my API key shown. Because this is just a small demo website I figured it won't be a big deal. I am aware of making server-side API requests and using environment variables to hide sensitive information.
